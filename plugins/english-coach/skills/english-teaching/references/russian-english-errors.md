# Common Russian-English Error Patterns

A comprehensive reference of errors Russian speakers commonly make in English, organized by category. For each pattern, the Russian linguistic reason is explained.

## Articles (a/an/the)

Russian has no article system. This is the single most persistent error category for Russian speakers.

### Missing Articles
- **Error**: "I wrote function" → needs "a function" or "the function"
- **Russian reason**: "Я написал функцию" — Russian uses no article; the noun stands alone
- **Rule**: Every countable singular noun in English needs a determiner (a, an, the, this, my, etc.)
- **When to use "a/an"**: First mention, non-specific, one of many
- **When to use "the"**: Already mentioned, specific, unique, shared knowledge

### Overuse of "the"
- **Error**: "The life is beautiful" → "Life is beautiful"
- **Russian reason**: Overapplying the rule after learning articles exist
- **Rule**: Abstract/general concepts and uncountable nouns used generally don't take "the"

### Confusing "a" and "the"
- **Error**: "I found the bug" (first mention) → "I found a bug"
- **Rule**: Use "a" for first introduction, "the" for subsequent references or shared context

## Prepositions

Russian prepositions map differently to English. Direct translation almost always produces errors.

### Common Mismatches

| Russian | Literal Transfer | Correct English |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| зависеть **от** | depend **from** | depend **on** |
| смотреть **на** | look **on** | look **at** |
| состоять **из** | consist **from** | consist **of** |
| влиять **на** | influence **on** | influence _(no prep)_ |
| отличаться **от** | differ **from** | differ **from** ✓ (same!) |
| интересоваться **+** inst. | interest **in** | be interested **in** ✓ |
| жениться **на** | marry **on** | marry _(no prep)_ |
| результат **+** gen. | result **of** | result **of** ✓ |
| ответить **на** | answer **on** | answer _(no prep)_ |
| подождать **+** acc. | wait **+** acc. | wait **for** |

### Direction vs. Location
- Russian uses different cases for direction and location
- English uses different prepositions: "go TO the office" vs. "work AT the office"
- Common error: "I go in office" (combining Russian "в" with English)

### Time Prepositions
- **in** — months, years, seasons, parts of day: "in January", "in 2024", "in the morning"
- **on** — days, dates: "on Monday", "on January 5th"
- **at** — precise times, exceptions: "at 3 PM", "at night", "at the weekend" (BrE)
- Russian uses "в" for most of these, so speakers often default to "in" for everything

## Verb Tenses

Russian has 3 tenses (past, present, future) with aspect (perfective/imperfective). English has 12 tense-aspect combinations. This mismatch causes systematic errors.

### Present Perfect vs. Past Simple
- **Error**: "I already did it" → "I have already done it"
- **Russian reason**: Russian past tense ("Я уже сделал") covers both English forms
- **Rule**: Use present perfect when the action has relevance to NOW (already, just, yet, ever, never, since, for)
- **Rule**: Use past simple for completed actions at a specific past time (yesterday, last week, in 2020)

### Present Perfect Continuous
- **Error**: "I work here since 2020" → "I have been working here since 2020"
- **Russian reason**: Russian uses present tense for ongoing situations ("Я работаю здесь с 2020")
- **Rule**: since/for + duration that continues now → present perfect continuous

### Future in Time Clauses
- **Error**: "When I will finish, I will call you" → "When I finish, I will call you"
- **Russian reason**: Russian uses future tense in both clauses ("Когда я закончу, я позвоню")
- **Rule**: After when/if/as soon as/until/before/after → use present simple, NOT future

### Conditional Structures
- **Error**: "If I would have time, I would help" → "If I had time, I would help"
- **Russian reason**: Russian conditional uses "бы" with past tense for all parts
- **Rule**: Second conditional: If + past simple, would + infinitive

---

## Word Order

Russian has flexible word order thanks to its case system. English word order is fixed (SVO).

### Subject-Verb-Object
- **Error**: "Yesterday the report I finished" → "Yesterday I finished the report"
- **Rule**: English requires Subject-Verb-Object order, with time expressions at start or end

### Adjective Order
- **Error**: "a red big car" → "a big red car"
- **Rule**: Opinion-Size-Age-Shape-Color-Origin-Material-Purpose (OSASCOMP)
- Note: Russians rarely encounter this rule explicitly

### Question Formation
- **Error**: "You can help me?" → "Can you help me?"
- **Russian reason**: Russian forms questions with intonation only
- **Rule**: Yes/no questions require auxiliary verb inversion

---

## Subject-Verb Agreement

### Uncountable Nouns
- **Error**: "The information are wrong" → "The information is wrong"
- **Russian reason**: "Информация" is grammatically singular in Russian too, but some nouns differ
- **Common uncountable nouns in English**: information, advice, news, research, equipment, software, hardware, data (modern usage)

### Collective Nouns
- **Error**: "The team are working" (can be correct in BrE, but inconsistent mixing)
- **Rule**: In American English, collective nouns take singular verbs. Be consistent within a text.

### There is/There are
- **Error**: "There is many problems" → "There are many problems"
- **Rule**: Match the verb to what follows: singular → "there is", plural → "there are"

## False Friends

Words that look or sound similar to Russian words but mean different things.

| English Word | Russian False Friend | Russian Meaning | Correct English |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| actual | актуальный | relevant/current | current, relevant |
| accurate | аккуратный | neat/tidy | neat, careful |
| fabric | фабрика | factory | factory |
| magazine | магазин | shop/store | shop, store |
| prospect | проспект | avenue/boulevard | avenue |
| genial | гениальный | genius/brilliant | brilliant |
| sympathetic | симпатичный | nice-looking | attractive, nice |
| data | дата | date (calendar) | date |
| complexion | комплекция | body build | build, physique |
| principal | принципиальный | principled | principled |
| conductor | кондуктор | bus ticket collector | ticket collector |

## Common Spelling Patterns

### Double Consonants
Russian speakers often under-double or over-double consonants:
- **necessary** (not "neccessary" or "necesary")
- **occurred** (not "occured")
- **beginning** (not "begining")
- **professional** (not "proffesional")

### Silent Letters
- **know**, **write**, **psychology**, **receipt**, **subtle**
- These don't exist in Russian's more phonetic spelling system

### -tion/-sion endings
- Usually pronounced /ʃən/: "function", "information", "decision"
- Spelling doesn't match pronunciation, unlike Russian
