## 1. Mnemonic Devices

### Acronym Mnemonics
Create memorable acronyms for rule sequences.

**Example — Adjective Order (OSASCOMP):**
> **O**pinion - **S**ize - **A**ge - **S**hape - **C**olor - **O**rigin - **M**aterial - **P**urpose
> "**O**ld **S**am **A**te **S**even **C**ookies **O**n **M**onday **P**lease"

**Example — Prepositions of Time:**
> "**AT** a time, **ON** a day, **IN** a month or longer stay"
> at 3 PM, on Monday, in January

### Story Mnemonics
Embed the rule in a memorable mini-story.

**Example — affect vs. effect:**
> "The **A**rrow **A**ffected the **A**ardvark. The **E**ffect was **E**normous."
> Affect = verb (action, starts with A), Effect = noun (end result, starts with E)

### Visual Mnemonics
Create mental images linking form to meaning.

**Example — stationary vs. stationery:**
> "Station**a**ry = standing still (imagine an **a**nchor holding you in place)"
> "Station**e**ry = **e**nvelopes and pens"

## 2. Pattern Grouping

### Irregular Verb Families
Group irregular verbs by their pattern:

**Pattern: i → a → u**
> drink → drank → drunk
> ring → rang → rung
> sing → sang → sung
> swim → swam → swum
> begin → began → begun

**Pattern: -ite → -ote → -itten**
> write → wrote → written
> bite → bit → bitten
> ride → rode → ridden

**Pattern: no change**
> put → put → put
> cut → cut → cut
> set → set → set
> shut → shut → shut

**Pattern: -ow → -ew → -own**
> know → knew → known
> grow → grew → grown
> blow → blew → blown
> throw → threw → thrown

### Preposition Clusters
Group verbs by the preposition they take:

**ON verbs**: depend on, rely on, work on, focus on, insist on, concentrate on, comment on
**AT verbs**: look at, aim at, arrive at, laugh at, stare at
**OF verbs**: consist of, think of, dream of, approve of, get rid of
**FOR verbs**: wait for, look for, apply for, ask for, pay for, search for
**TO verbs**: refer to, relate to, respond to, listen to, belong to, object to

## 3. Russian-English Bridge Technique

### Contrastive Analysis
Explicitly compare Russian and English structures side by side.

**Template:**
> Russian: [Russian sentence] — [literal translation]
> English: [correct English] — [explanation of difference]

**Example — Articles:**
> Russian: "Я написал функцию" — "I wrote function"
> English: "I wrote **a** function" — English needs an article because "function" is a countable noun mentioned for the first time

**Example — Present Perfect:**
> Russian: "Я уже сделал это" — "I already did this" (past tense in Russian)
> English: "I **have already done** this" — English uses present perfect because "already" signals relevance to now

### False Friend Flash Cards
For each false friend, create a two-sided association:

**Card Front**: "actual" (English)
**Card Back**: Does NOT mean "актуальный" (current/relevant). MEANS: real, true, existing.
**Sentence**: "The actual cost was higher than estimated."
**Russian equivalent of English meaning**: "настоящий, фактический"

## 4. Spaced Repetition Prompts

### Session Callbacks
When a previously-taught pattern appears again:

**First occurrence** (new error):
> Full teaching: rule explanation + 3 examples + memorization technique

**Second occurrence** (1-3 sessions later):
> Brief reminder: "Remember our rule about [X]? This is the same pattern. Hint: [shorter hint]"

**Third occurrence** (3+ sessions later):
> Quick nudge: "I see [error type] again. You know this one — what's the rule?"

**Fourth occurrence** (mastery check):
> Just flag it: "Check: [quoted text] — you've seen this pattern before."

### Progress Markers
Track where each error pattern is in the repetition cycle:
- **New**: First seen, needs full explanation
- **Learning**: Seen 2-3 times, needs reminders
- **Familiar**: Seen 4+ times, needs only nudges
- **Mastered**: Self-corrected without hints 3 times in a row

## 5. Context-Based Learning

### Technical Vocabulary in Context
Instead of teaching isolated words, teach them in coding contexts the user encounters daily.

**Example — "implement" vs "realize":**
> Wrong: "I need to realize this feature" (Russian: "реализовать")
> Right: "I need to **implement** this feature"
> Context: "implement" = build/code something; "realize" = understand/become aware
> Technical usage: "We **implemented** the API endpoint" / "I **realized** the bug was in the parser"

### Sentence Frames
Provide fill-in-the-blank patterns the user can reuse:

**For asking for review:**
> "Could you _____ my pull request?"
> Options: review, look at, check, go through
> NOT: "look on", "see at"

**For describing problems:**
> "The tests are _____ because _____."
> "I'm _____ (stuck/blocked) on _____."
> "This approach doesn't _____ (work/scale)."

**For proposing solutions:**
> "I suggest _____ (-ing form)."
> "What if we _____ (past simple for hypothetical)?"
> "We could _____ (base verb)."

## 6. Error Journaling

### Personal Error Log
Encourage the user to notice patterns in their own errors:

**Log Entry Format:**
```
Date: [date]
My sentence: "[what I wrote]"
Error type: [grammar/spelling/vocabulary/preposition]
Rule: [the rule I broke]
Pattern: [is this related to Russian?]
Correct form: [what I should have written]
```

### Weekly Review Pattern
After accumulating entries, identify:
1. Most frequent error type
2. Error that keeps repeating despite learning
3. Error that was successfully eliminated
4. New error that appeared

## 7. Chunking Technique

### Fixed Phrases
Instead of building sentences word-by-word, learn common phrases as chunks:

**Technical chunks:**
- "as far as I know" (not "as far as I am knowing")
- "it depends on" (not "it depends from")
- "I'm looking forward to" + -ing (not "to" + base verb)
- "I would appreciate it if you could" (polite request)
- "on the other hand" (contrast)
- "in terms of" (regarding)

**Coding communication chunks:**
- "I've been working on..."
- "This is caused by..."
- "I'd suggest we..."
- "Does this look right to you?"
- "Let me know if you need anything else."
- "I'll get back to you on that."

### Chunk Practice
Present the chunk → Show 3 examples → Ask user to create their own sentence using it.

## 8. Minimal Pair Practice

### Sound Pairs
For pronunciation-related spelling errors, use minimal pairs:

**ship / sheep**: short i vs. long ee
**live / leave**: different vowel lengths
**think / sink**: th vs. s (common for Russian speakers)
**very / wary**: v vs. w (Russian speakers often confuse)

### Spelling Pairs
For commonly confused spellings:

**their / there / they're**: Ownership / Place / They are
**its / it's**: Possession / It is (apostrophe = contraction, NOT possession for "it")
**affect / effect**: Verb / Noun (usually)
**then / than**: Time / Comparison
